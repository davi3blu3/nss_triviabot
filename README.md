# NSS 'n Friends TriviaBot Slack API

## What is TriviaBot?

The NSS 'n Friends TriviaBot Slack API is an experimental Slack integration for the purpose of generating polls for our Slack team without a usage limit. Each week we will use it to decide which day and venue to go to trivia in the beautiful city of Nashville, TN.

This is a Node.js app using Express 4 and hosted on Heroku.
